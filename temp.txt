General Description
MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A sensors with
Linear Active Thermistor Integrated Circuit (IC) comprise a family of analog temperature sensors that
convert temperature to analog voltage.
The low-cost, low-power sensors feature an accuracy
of ±2°C from 0°C to +70°C (MCP9700A/9701A) and
±4°C from 0°C to +70°C (MCP9700/9701) while
consuming 6 µA (typical) of operating current.
Unlike resistive sensors, e.g., thermistors, the Linear
Active Thermistor IC does not require an additional
signal-conditioning circuit. Therefore, the biasing circuit
development overhead for thermistor solutions can be
avoided by implementing a sensor from these low-cost
devices. The Voltage Output pin (VOUT) can be directly
connected to the ADC input of a microcontroller. The
MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A temperature
coefficients are scaled to provide a 1°C/bit resolution
for an 8-bit ADC with a reference voltage of 2.5V and
5V, respectively. The MCP9700/9700A output 0.1°C/bit
for a 12-bit ADC with 4.096V reference.
The MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A provide a
low-cost solution for applications that require measurement of a relative change of temperature. When measuring relative change in temperature from +25°C, an
accuracy of ±1°C (typical) can be realized from 0°C to
+70°C. This accuracy can also be achieved by applying
system calibration at +25°C.
In addition, this family of devices is immune to the
effects of parasitic capacitance and can drive large
capacitive loads. This provides printed circuit board
(PCB) layout design flexibility by enabling the device to
be remotely located from the microcontroller. Adding
some capacitance at the output also helps the output
transient response by reducing overshoots or
undershoots. However, capacitive load is not required
for the stability of sensor output.

4.0 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION
The Linear Active Thermistor™ IC uses an internal
diode to measure temperature. The diode electrical
characteristics have a temperature coefficient that
provides a change in voltage based on the relative
ambient temperature from -40°C to 150°C. The change
in voltage is scaled to a temperature coefficient of
10.0 mV/°C (typical) for the MCP9700/9700A and
19.5 mV/°C (typical) for the MCP9701/9701A. The
output voltage at 0°C is also scaled to 500 mV (typical)
and 400 mV (typical) for the MCP9700/9700A and
MCP9701/9701A, respectively. This linear scale is
described in the first-order transfer function shown in
Equation 4-1 and Figure 2-16.
EQUATION 4-1: SENSOR TRANSFER
FUNCTION
FIGURE 4-1: Typical Application Circuit.
4.1 Improving Accuracy
The MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A accuracy
can be improved by performing a system calibration at
a specific temperature. For example, calibrating the
system at +25°C ambient improves the measurement
accuracy to a ±0.5°C (typical) from 0°C to +70°C, as
shown in Figure 4-2. Therefore, when measuring
relative temperature change, this family of devices
measures temperature with higher accuracy.
FIGURE 4-2: Relative Accuracy to +25°C
vs. Temperature.
The change in accuracy from the calibration temperature is due to the output nonlinearity from the first-order
equation, as specified in Equation 4-2. The accuracy
can be further improved by compensating for the output
nonlinearity.
For higher accuracy using a sensor compensation
technique, refer to Application Note AN1001,
“IC Temperature Sensor Accuracy Compensation with
a PIC® Microcontroller” (DS00001001). The application
note shows that if the device is compensated in
addition to room temperature calibration, the sensor
accuracy can be improved to ±0.5°C (typical) accuracy
over the operating temperature (Figure 4-3).
FIGURE 4-3: MCP9700/9700A Calibrated
Sensor Accuracy.
The compensation technique provides a linear
temperature reading. The application note includes
compensation firmware so that a look-up table can be
generated to compensate for the sensor error.

MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A
4.2 Shutdown Using Microcontroller
I/O Pin
The 6 µA (typical) low operating current of the
MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A family makes it
ideal for battery-powered applications. However, for
applications that require a tighter current budget, this
device can be powered using a microcontroller
Input/Output (I/O) pin. The I/O pin can be toggled to
shut down the device. In such applications, the microcontroller internal digital switching noise is emitted to
the MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A as power
supply noise. However, this switching noise compromises measurement accuracy, therefore a decoupling
capacitor and series resistor will be necessary to filter
out the system noise.
4.3 Layout Considerations
The MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A family of
sensors does not require any additional components to
operate. However, it is recommended that a decoupling
capacitor of 0.1 µF to 1 µF be used between the
VDD and GND pins. In high-noise applications, connect
the power supply voltage to the VDD pin using a
200 resistor with a 1 µF decoupling capacitor. A high
frequency ceramic capacitor is recommended. It is necessary that the capacitor is located as close as possible
to the VDD and GND pins in order to provide effective
noise protection. In addition, avoid tracing digital lines
in close proximity to the sensor.
4.4 Thermal Considerations
The MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A family
measures temperature by monitoring the voltage of a
diode located in the die. A low-impedance thermal path
between the die and the PCB is provided by the pins.
Therefore, the sensor effectively monitors the
temperature of the PCB. However, the thermal path for
the ambient air is not as efficient because the plastic
device package functions as a thermal insulator from
the die. This limitation applies to plastic-packaged
silicon temperature sensors. If the application requires
the measurement of ambient air, the TO-92 package
should be considered.
The MCP9700/9700A and MCP9701/9701A sensors
are designed to source/sink 100 µA (max.). The power
dissipation due to the output current is relatively
insignificant. The effect of the output current can be
described by Equation 4-2.
EQUATION 4-2: EFFECT OF
SELF-HEATING
At TA = +25°C (VOUT = 0.75V) and maximum
specification of IDD = 12 µA, VDD = 5.5V and
IOUT = +100 µA, the self-heating due to power
dissipation (TJ – TA) is 0.179°C.
TJ TA – JA VDDIDD VDD VOUT +   – IOUT =  
Where:
TJ = Junction Temperature
TA = Ambient Temperature
JA = Package Thermal Resistance (331°C/W)
VOUT = Sensor Output Voltage
IOUT = Sensor Output Current
IDD = Operating Current
VDD = Operating Voltage

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
• Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
• Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
intended manner and under normal conditions.
• There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
• Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
• Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Microchip received ISO/TS-16949:2009 certification for its worldwide
headquarters, design and wafer fabrication facilities in Chandler and
Tempe, Arizona; Gresham, Oregon and design centers in California
and India. The Company’s quality system processes and procedures
are for its PIC® MCUs and dsPIC® DSCs, KEELOQ® code hopping
