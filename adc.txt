Description
The Microchip Technology Inc. MCP3201 device is a
successive approximation 12-bit Analog-to-Digital
(A/D) Converter with on-board sample and hold
circuitry. The device provides a single pseudo-differential input. Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) is specified at
±1 LSB, and Integral Nonlinearity (INL) is offered in
±1 LSB (MCP3201-B) and ±2 LSB (MCP3201-C)
versions. Communication with the device is done using
a simple serial interface compatible with the SPI
protocol. The device is capable of sample rates of up to
100 ksps at a clock rate of 1.6 MHz. The MCP3201
device operates over a broad voltage range (2.7V5.5V). Low-current design permits operation with
typical standby and active currents of only 500 nA and
300 µA, respectively. The device is offered in 8-pin
MSOP, PDIP, TSSOP and 150 mil SOIC packages.

4.0 DEVICE OPERATION
The MCP3201 A/D Converter employs a conventional
SAR architecture. With this architecture, a sample is
acquired on an internal sample/hold capacitor for
1.5 clock cycles starting on the first rising edge of the
serial clock after CS has been pulled low. Following this
sample time, the input switch of the converter opens
and the device uses the collected charge on the
internal sample and hold capacitor to produce a serial
12-bit digital output code. Conversion rates of 100 ksps
are possible on the MCP3201 device. See Section 6.2
“Maintaining Minimum Clock Speed” for information
on minimum clock rates. Communication with the
device is done using a 3-wire SPI-compatible interface.
4.1 Analog Inputs
The MCP3201 device provides a single pseudo-differential input. The IN+ input can range from IN- to VREF
(VREF + IN-). The IN- input is limited to ±100 mV from
the VSS rail. The IN- input can be used to cancel small
signal common-mode noise which is present on both
the IN+ and IN- inputs.
For the A/D Converter to meet specification, the charge
holding capacitor (CSAMPLE) must be given enough
time to acquire a 12-bit accurate voltage level during
the 1.5 clock cycle sampling period. The analog input
model is shown in Figure 4-1.
In this diagram, it is shown that the source impedance
(RS) adds to the internal sampling switch (RSS)
impedance, directly affecting the time that is required to
charge the capacitor (CSAMPLE). Consequently, a
larger source impedance increases the offset, gain,
and integral linearity errors of the conversion.
Ideally, the impedance of the signal source should be
near zero. This is achievable with an operational
amplifier such as the MCP601, which has a closed loop
output impedance of tens of ohms. The adverse affects
of higher source impedances are shown in Figure 4-2.
If the voltage level of IN+ is equal to or less than IN-, the
resultant code will be 000h. If the voltage at IN+ is equal
to or greater than {[VREF + (IN-)] - 1 LSB}, then the
output code will be FFFh. If the voltage level at IN- is
more than 1 LSB below VSS, then the voltage level at
the IN+ input will have to go below VSS to see the 000h
output code. Conversely, if IN- is more than 1 LSB
above VSS, then the FFFh code will not be seen unless
the IN+ input level goes above VREF level.
4.2 Reference Input
The reference input (VREF) determines the analog input
voltage range and the LSB size, as shown below.
EQUATION 4-1:
As the reference input is reduced, the LSB size is
reduced accordingly. The theoretical digital output code
produced by the A/D Converter is a function of the
analog input signal and the reference input as shown
below.
EQUATION 4-2:
When using an external voltage reference device, the
system designer should always refer to the
manufacturer’s recommendations for circuit layout.
Any instability in the operation of the reference device
will have a direct effect on the operation of the
A/D Converter.

5.0 SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS
Communication with the device is done using a
standard SPI-compatible serial interface. Initiating
communication with the MCP3201 device begins with
the CS going low. If the device was powered up with the
CS pin low, it must be brought high and back low to
initiate communication. The device will begin to sample
the analog input on the first rising edge after CS goes
low. The sample period will end in the falling edge of the
second clock, at which time the device will output a low
null bit. The next 12 clocks will output the result of the
conversion with MSB first, as shown in Figure 5-1. Data
is always output from the device on the falling edge of
the clock. If all 12 data bits have been transmitted and
the device continues to receive clocks while the CS is
held low, the device will output the conversion result
LSB first, as shown in Figure 5-2. If more clocks are
provided to the device while CS is still low (after the
LSB first data has been transmitted), the device will
clock out zeros indefinitely.

6.0 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION
6.1 Using the MCP3201 Device with
Microcontroller SPI Ports
With most microcontroller SPI ports, it is required to
clock out eight bits at a time. If this is the case, it will be
necessary to provide more clocks than are required for
the MCP3201. As an example, Figure 6-1 and
Figure 6-2 show how the MCP3201 device can be
interfaced to a microcontroller with a standard SPI port.
Since the MCP3201 always clocks data out on the
falling edge of clock, the MCU SPI port must be
configured to match this operation. SPI Mode 0,0 (clock
idles low) and SPI Mode 1,1 (clock idles high) are both
compatible with the MCP3201. Figure 6-1 depicts the
operation shown in SPI Mode 0,0, which requires that
the CLK from the microcontroller idles in the ‘low’ state.
As shown in the diagram, the MSB is clocked out of the
A/D Converter on the falling edge of the third clock
pulse. After the first eight clocks have been sent to the
device, the microcontroller’s receive buffer will contain
two unknown bits (the output is at high-impedance for
the first two clocks), the null bit and the highest order
five bits of the conversion. After the second eight clocks
have been sent to the device, the MCU receive register
will contain the lowest-order seven bits and the B1 bit
repeated as the A/D Converter has begun to shift out
LSB first data with the extra clock. Typical procedure
would then call for the lower-order byte of data to be
shifted right by one bit to remove the extra B1 bit. The
B7 bit is then transferred from the high-order byte to the
lower-order byte, and then the higher-order byte is
shifted one bit to the right as well. Easier manipulation
of the converted data can be obtained by using this
method.
Figure 6-2 shows the same thing in SPI Mode 1,1
which requires that the clock idles in the high state. As
with mode 0,0, the A/D Converter outputs data on the
falling edge of the clock and the MCU latches data from
the A/D Converter in on the rising edge of the clock.

6.2 Maintaining Minimum Clock Speed
When the MCP3201 initiates the sample period, charge
is stored on the sample capacitor. When the sample
period is complete, the device converts one bit for each
clock that is received. It is important for the user to note
that a slow clock rate will allow charge to bleed off the
sample cap while the conversion is taking place. At
85°C (worst-case condition), the part will maintain
proper charge on the sample capacitor for at least
1.2 ms after the sample period has ended. This means
that the time between the end of the sample period and
the time that all 12 data bits have been clocked out
must not exceed 1.2 ms (effective clock frequency of
10 kHz). Failure to meet this criteria may induce
linearity errors into the conversion outside the rated
specifications. It should be noted that during the entire
conversion cycle, the A/D Converter does not require a
constant clock speed or duty cycle, as long as all timing
specifications are met.
6.3 Buffering/Filtering the Analog
Inputs
If the signal source for the A/D Converter is not a lowimpedance source, it will have to be buffered
or inaccurate conversion results may occur.
See Figure 4-2. It is also recommended that a filter be
used to eliminate any signals that may be aliased back
into the conversion results. This is illustrated in
Figure 6-3 where an op amp is used to drive the analog
input of the MCP3201 device. This amplifier provides a
low-impedance source for the converter input and a
low-pass filter, which eliminates unwanted highfrequency noise.
Low-pass (anti-aliasing) filters can be designed using
Microchip’s interactive FilterLab® software. FilterLab
will calculate capacitor and resistor values, as well as
determine the number of poles that are required for the
application. For more information on filtering signals,
see application note AN699 “Anti-Aliasing Analog
Filters for Data Acquisition Systems.”

Amplifier is used to implement a 2nd order antialiasing filter for the signal being converted by

6.4 Layout Considerations
When laying out a printed circuit board for use with
analog components, care should be taken to reduce
noise wherever possible. A bypass capacitor should
always be used with this device and should be placed
as close as possible to the device pin. A bypass
capacitor value of 1 µF is recommended.
Digital and analog traces should be separated as much
as possible on the board and no traces should run
underneath the device or the bypass capacitor. Extra
precautions should be taken to keep traces with highfrequency signals (such as clock lines) as far as
possible from analog traces.
Use of an analog ground plane is recommended in
order to keep the ground potential the same for all
devices on the board. Providing VDD connections to
devices in a “star” configuration can also reduce noise
by eliminating current return paths and associated
errors. See Figure 6-4. For more information on layout
tips when using A/D Converter, refer to AN688 “Layout
Tips for 12-Bit A/D Converter Applications”.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
• Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
• Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
intended manner and under normal conditions.
• There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
• Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
• Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Microchip received ISO/TS-16949:2009 certification for its worldwide
headquarters, design and wafer fabrication facilities in Chandler and
Tempe, Arizona; Gresham, Oregon and design centers in California
and India. The Company’s quality system processes and procedures
are for its PIC® MCUs and dsPIC® DSCs, KEELOQ® code hopping
devices, Serial EEPROMs, microperipherals, nonvolatile memory and
analog products. In addition, Microchip’s quality system for the design
and manufacture of development systems is ISO 9001:2000 certified.
